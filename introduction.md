### Motivation for OpenMRS Android Client

In Hospitals, Clinics there arenâ€™t many computers and most of the work is done manually. It include a tiresome work to maintain patient records manually.

Market share of Android point is around 82%. Due to cheap prices and popularity of android phones, apps can be used to do the work easily and efficiently. It is especially useful for developing countries. We can also use some features provided by phones like camera, GPS, voice recording etc to make it even more useful.

An Android app which work smoothly and make the hospital/clinical staff more efficient is much needed. Instead of large size computer which allows little flexibility, the clinical staff can use android phones/tablets.
